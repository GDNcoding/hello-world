Just another repository
Tired of being in the retail sales environment. Felt like my potential and abilities are wasting away every time I step into my job so I decided to pick up where I left off with my education. Comp Sci was always what I wanted to do ever since I touched my first computer, but I didn't want to conform to the 4-year degree process. So happy I was able to find freecodecamp and so here I am. What's your story?
